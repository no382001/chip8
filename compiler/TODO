- optimisations
    - const folding
    - peephole wherever
    - dead code
    - strength reduction
    - loop unrolling, maybe?

compiler:
    - dont use v15 for conditionals
    - spill to memory

notes:
    - only the temporary operations occupy registers and free them, ergo variables are always alive

parser reimplementation:
    - add a way to parse hex values
    - allow values bigger than 255? operations can overflow so why restrict it?
    - do const folding in the parser (its easier that way)
